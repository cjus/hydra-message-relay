# Message relay service

Hydra Message Relay - a simple microservice which replies to WebSocket messages received via Hydra-router

This service requires the following:

* A Redis instance for Hyra to use
* A Hydra-Router
* This service running

You can then launch the `websocket-test.html` file to send WebSocket message through Hydra-Router to this Hydra-message-relay service.
